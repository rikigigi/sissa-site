<strong>  Prin project "The consequences of flavour: from precision measurements to fundamental physics" (2017L5W2PT) </strong>(2019/ 2022) <br/>
<p>The goal of this project is to study the origin of masses and flavour mixings of the elementary fermions, deriving experimental and theoretical implications of possible solutions to the flavour problem. On one
hand, this will be done by means of theoretical investigation, following a new direction of research in which flavour arises as an accidental consequence of dynamical properties of a more fundamental theory.
On the other hand, we will explore the phenomenology of new physics models in the flavour sector, taking advantage of the large amount of data that experiments will provide in the coming years. We will
exploit the interplay of flavour and electroweak precision measurements and high-energy searches at colliders. Particular attention will be given to the study of lepton flavour universality violations, a topic that
will be at the core of theoretical and experimental investigation in particle physics in the next few years. In this respect, we will study models that aim to explain in a coherent way the various experimental
anomalies observed in B meson decays. <p></p>
<p>The  collaboration will include young researchers  from INFN (Pisa,Trieste,Firenze) SISSA and La Sapienza. The main part of the funding will be used for hiring young postdoctoral researchers in order to form a strong and competitive team.

<strong>  Prin project "Non-Perturbative Aspects of Gauge Theories and Strings" (2015MP2CX4) </strong> (Feb 2017/ Feb 2020) <br/>
<p>The purpose of this project is to promote the study of (supersymmetric) gauge theories and of string theory with particular emphasis on their non-perturbative aspects.<p></p>
<p>The main tools that will be used to go beyond perturbation theory and get a handle on the strongly coupled dynamics are supersymmetry and holography. They both find a natural embedding in string theory. Over the years string theory has emerged as a compelling candidate for a unified quantum theory of all fundamental interactions including gravity, and has also provided many successful ideas to study quantum field theories not only in their perturbative regime but also at strong coupling.<p></p>
<p>The primary challenge of this project is to establish a more solid and predictive connection among the various aspects of this research field. This project will be devoted to explore in particular the following topics:<p></p>
<p>A) Supersymmetric Gauge Theories <br/>
B) Holography <br/>
C) Instanton Effects in Gauge and String Theories<p></p>
<p>The participants in this project have complementary expertise, cover a wide range of topics in string and quantum field theories and have a good record of collaborations and interactions among them. In the past they have achieved several important results whose relevance is internationally acknowledged, as demonstrated by the number of “top-cited” papers they have published. All participants have been involved in past PRIN projects and have been members of European research and training networks in string theory and quantum field theory for many years. <p></p>
<p>This project consists of the elaboration of theoretical models within a rapidly evolving context, which requires close contact and frequent interactions among scientists. Thus, to increase collaborations among the participating teams, we plan to organize common activities, for example informal workshops and periodic meetings, and to promote mobility of the participants. A substantial part of the budget will be devoted to hiring and training young post-docs.<p></p>

<strong>PRIN project "Search for the Fundamental Laws and Constituents" (2015P5SBHT_002)  </strong> (Feb 2017/ Feb 2020)<br/>
<p>The discovery of a light, weakly interacting Higgs particle is the crowning achievement of the Standard Model, which completes a long series of tremendous successes. In spite of this, however, most of the fundamental questions about the constituents and the forces of Nature, and about the structure and composition of our Universe, remain unanswered. We mention here: the origin of the Higgs sector responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the generation of the masses of the fundamental particles; the origin and properties of flavor; the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other forces in Nature and its quantization; matter antimatter asymmetry; inflation; the origin of dark matter (DM) and dark energy in the Universe. Each of these questions represents by itself a strong theoretical reason to go beyond the SM and it is conceivable that many of them have a common explanation.<p></p>
<p>A deeper picture can only emerge from a combined approach which tries to explore simultaneously the experimental information coming from the energy frontier (precision measurements of the Higgs properties and searches of new particles at LHC), the intensity frontier (quark and lepton flavour physics) and the astroparticle and cosmological frontier. The main goal of this project consists in identifying coherent explanations of the different phenomena and fundamental questions by combining the vast experimental information coming from the forthcoming experiments, in particular from the LHC, with the most advanced theoretical developments. This objective requires a global strategy that makes use of strong competences in several different fields of investigation. In order to achieve this goal, we put together some of the leading particle physics theorists operating in Firenze, Napoli, Padova, Roma La Sapienza, Roma Tre, SNS and SISSA into a very experienced and strong team.<p></p>

<strong> InvisiblesPlus EU project, </strong> (Feb 2016/ Jan 2020)<br/>
<p>InvisiblesPlus is a new Horizon2020 (H2020) Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) project. The project (690575 - InvisiblesPlus - H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015, February 2016- January 2020), will focus on Neutrino and Dark Matter phenomenology and their connection, with emphasis on the role of the symmetry relating matter and antimatter. Experimental and theoretical aspects are also encompassed. The network involves 13 nodes in six European countries and its associated partners extend to nine non-European countries.<p></p>
<p>This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 690575.<p></p>

<strong> ELUSIVES EU project </strong> (Feb 2016/ Jan 2020)<br/>
<p>Elusives is a European ITN project (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015//674896-ELUSIVES, April 2016-March 2020), which focuses on Neutrino and Dark Matter phenomenology and their connection. Phenomenological and theoretical aspects are also encompassed. The network involves nodes in six European countries and its associated partners extend to seven non-European countries.<p></p>
<p>The mission of Elusives ITN is to form the new generation of researchers to accomplish the task of understanding the fundamental spects of neutrino mixng and the nature of Dark Matter and the possible connection, if any, between the two, focusing on  phenomenology with the necessary link to experiment. This is the first transnational such program, exploiting the capital investment in new experiments and overcoming the fragmentation of the research effort.<p></p>
<p>This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020
                         research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 674896.<p></p>
