# Generator scripts for sissa site
Riccardo Bertossa, SISSA, 2020

## Generation process overview
The site (`out.html`) is generated by running the command
```
./template.sh
```
The generator script is written in bash and it is commented, you should have a look at it. The `CSS` and `JS` global variables are modified by some subscripts that are called by the main one. In the generation process there is some css code that is piped through `sass --scss`, so you will need this tool installed. On Ubuntu you can install it by running `sudo apt install sass`. 

The content is stored in separate files:
 - `intro`
 - `representative`
 - `alumni` -- automatically generated by a python script!
 - `grants` -- automatically generated by a python script!
 - `convenzione`
 - `excellence_coll`
 - `colloquia`
 
 ## Generation of `alumni` and `grants` files
 They are generated by python scripts in the [parsers/]() directory called (surprise) `alumni.py` and `grants.py`. They work by downloading some SISSA site's webpages and parsing them with a python library. To see the command line options:
 ```
 cd parsers
 ./alumni.py --help
 ./grants.py --help
 ```
 In particular, if you want that the source webpages are downloaded and parsed again you should use the `--parse-url` command line option, that stores the parser result in the file (surprise) `alumni.pickle` and `grants.pickle`. If you run the scripts without any option, they will simply load those pickle files and produce again the html output that can be redirected to the `alumni` and `grants` files:
 ```
 ./alumni.py > ../alumni
 ./grants.py > ../grants
 ```
 If you want to do some experiments, have a look at the python code and to the jupyter notebook [tests.ipynb]()
