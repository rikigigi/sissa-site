External PhD students (especially foreign ones) can apply to this program so to have coverage of their local expenses while attending in SISSA some courses of our PhDs. The application can be send directly to the relevant PhD coordinators.

<h3>Visiting Student Program</h3>
<p>
This is a program aimed at offering a service to the national higher education system, by which Italian universities can setup agreements with us so to share graduate students, for example allowing external students to follow specific courses offered by the Areaâ€™s PhDs. Students in the program can also apply for the support provided by the Student Training Program in case of insufficient financing by their home institution. You can download a draft of the agreement template using the following link.
