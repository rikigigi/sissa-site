       "   The main tools that will be used to go beyond perturbation theory and get a handle on the strongly coupled dynamics are supersymmetry and holography. They both find a natural embedding in string theory. Over the years string theory has emerged as a compelling candidate for a unified quantum theory of all fundamental interactions including gravity, and has also provided many successful ideas to study quantum field theories not only in their perturbative regime but also at strong coupling.\n",
       "   The primary challenge of this project is to establish a more solid and predictive connection among the various aspects of this research field. This project will be devoted to explore in particular the following topics:\n",
       "   A) Supersymmetric Gauge Theories <br/>\n",
       "   B) Holography <br/>\n",
       "   C) Instanton Effects in Gauge and String Theories\n",
       "   The participants in this project have complementary expertise, cover a wide range of topics in string and quantum field theories and have a good record of collaborations and interactions among them. In the past they have achieved several important results whose relevance is internationally acknowledged, as demonstrated by the number of “top-cited” papers they have published. All participants have been involved in past PRIN projects and have been members of European research and training networks in string theory and quantum field theory for many years. \n",
       "   This project consists of the elaboration of theoretical models within a rapidly evolving context, which requires close contact and frequent interactions among scientists. Thus, to increase collaborations among the participating teams, we plan to organize common activities, for example informal workshops and periodic meetings, and to promote mobility of the participants. A substantial part of the budget will be devoted to hiring and training young post-docs.\n",

       "   The discovery of a light, weakly interacting Higgs particle is the crowning achievement of the Standard Model, which completes a long series of tremendous successes. In spite of this, however, most of the fundamental questions about the constituents and the forces of Nature, and about the structure and composition of our Universe, remain unanswered. We mention here: the origin of the Higgs sector responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the generation of the masses of the fundamental particles; the origin and properties of flavor; the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other forces in Nature and its quantization; matter antimatter asymmetry; inflation; the origin of dark matter (DM) and dark energy in the Universe. Each of these questions represents by itself a strong theoretical reason to go beyond the SM and it is conceivable that many of them have a common explanation.\n",
       "   A deeper picture can only emerge from a combined approach which tries to explore simultaneously the experimental information coming from the energy frontier (precision measurements of the Higgs properties and searches of new particles at LHC), the intensity frontier (quark and lepton flavour physics) and the astroparticle and cosmological frontier. The main goal of this project consists in identifying coherent explanations of the different phenomena and fundamental questions by combining the vast experimental information coming from the forthcoming experiments, in particular from the LHC, with the most advanced theoretical developments. This objective requires a global strategy that makes use of strong competences in several different fields of investigation. In order to achieve this goal, we put together some of the leading particle physics theorists operating in Firenze, Napoli, Padova, Roma La Sapienza, Roma Tre, SNS and SISSA into a very experienced and strong team.\n",
